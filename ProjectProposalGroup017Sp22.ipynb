    "Why it is of interest to us:\n",
    "Climate change is a now problem, but it often seems that many understand climate change as a “future” problem. We wanted to provide a new perspective on why we must make changes to prevent climate change now. It has been said that “younger generations are the future” and we believe that. However, what if we could show how pollutants are impacting younger generations now? What if it was obvious that impact of climate change is more than volatile weather to come? That’s what we want to do by answering this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to research, we all knew that pollution wasn’t a good thing. After diving deeper, we found that expoure to air pollution for extended times can be impacting factor in respiratory diseases like asthma and lung cancer (1). In a study, we found that respiratory illnesses can be attributed to pollution, however, this can be broken down into outdoor and indoor pollutants **(1)**. From this, we know that the association between pollutants and respiratory disease is true, but to what degree and amongst whom?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are concerned with younger persons i.e. the future, we wanted to explore any prior work regarding the development of respiratory illness. Eventually, we reviewed a study that focused on the implications of lung diseases with early exposure **(2)**. By closely measuring pollution at the chemical level, associations were able to be formed regarding the impact on individuals **(2)**. One particular focus of this study found associations in prenatal air pollution exposure with several impacts on birth, along with this, the study revealed both short-term and long-term effects on respiratory health **(2)**.\n",

    "*We believe that higher rates of pollution will result in higher rates of lung cancer among people of age 25 and younger. These higher rates of pollution will be quanitfied by the amounts of chemicals in the air that are considered to be risk factors to cancer. Wherever there are a higher concentration of these chemicals these will be marked as bad air quality and the places that have worse air quality will lead to a higher rate of cancer in this age range of people than other places that aren’t as contaminated with poor air quality.*"

    " The ideal dataset we want is a dataset with AQI(air quality index) by county/state, cancer rate by county/state, count of cancer cases by county/state, NO2 units. The dataset should include a lot of observations like millions of observations, the data should be collected by the government institutes like CDC, and the US Weather Bureau.. The data should be collected by from the data provided by hospitals from different areas. These data should be stored in a semi-structured format like .csv and we also want tidy data with each variable we measure in a single column, and each variable on a different row. If the data is not clean we will do the job. \n",

    "*In this project our data won’t set social disparities, meaning there won't be any biases in the data. We’ll be using adequate data covering our population of interest so if testing under 25 year olds that’ll be all and not just certain groups. If we’re establishing the causality of air pollution to cancer we’ll have enough data to actually show that causality. This is a question that’s been brought up before and that we all know a good amount of that we’ll add to. There are articles https://www.cbs8.com/article/news/health/report-ranks-san-diego-as-5th-most-polluted-large-metro-area-in-the-us/509-0eed866f-5745-4c7a-ae8c-259ebfbe6602 that have made these claims and we’ll be working in finding more information. Our question and results don’t have implications that we wouldn’t predict that would cause harm since it’ll be something that affects us all. Air quality is influenced by many reasons including pollution. Our data will be obtained from government public websites that anyone has access to and guarantees anonymity.*"
