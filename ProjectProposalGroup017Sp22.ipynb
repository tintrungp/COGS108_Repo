    "Why it is of interest to us:\n",
    "Climate change is a now problem, but it often seems that many understand climate change as a “future” problem. We wanted to provide a new perspective on why we must make changes to prevent climate change now. It has been said that “younger generations are the future” and we believe that. However, what if we could show how pollutants are impacting younger generations now? What if it was obvious that impact of climate change is more than volatile weather to come? That’s what we want to do by answering this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to research, we all knew that pollution wasn’t a good thing. After diving deeper, we found that expoure to air pollution for extended times can be impacting factor in respiratory diseases like asthma and lung cancer (1). In a study, we found that respiratory illnesses can be attributed to pollution, however, this can be broken down into outdoor and indoor pollutants **(1)**. From this, we know that the association between pollutants and respiratory disease is true, but to what degree and amongst whom?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are concerned with younger persons i.e. the future, we wanted to explore any prior work regarding the development of respiratory illness. Eventually, we reviewed a study that focused on the implications of lung diseases with early exposure **(2)**. By closely measuring pollution at the chemical level, associations were able to be formed regarding the impact on individuals **(2)**. One particular focus of this study found associations in prenatal air pollution exposure with several impacts on birth, along with this, the study revealed both short-term and long-term effects on respiratory health **(2)**.\n",
