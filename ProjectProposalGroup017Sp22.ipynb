    "Climate change is a now problem, but it often seems that many understand climate change as a “future” problem. We wanted to provide a new perspective on why we must make changes to prevent climate change now. It has been said that “younger generations are the future” and we believe that. However, what if we could show how pollutants are impacting younger generations now? What if it was obvious that impact of climate change is more than volatile weather to come? That’s what we want to do by answering this question. \n",
